Stress detection in banana plants using remote sensing, machine learning, computer vision and bayesian networks.

- Three experiments were done with the purpose of stress detection in banana plants.
- The banana plants were grown in a greenhouse and monitored using different cameras - RGB, thermal and depth cameras.
- The plants were divided to groups each receiving different amount of water \ fertilizer treatment - intentionally causing stress to some groups.
- Features of size, colour, temperature and height were extracted daily from the images.
- My algorithm (CDDRL) which is based on bayesian networks had the task of classifying stressed and non-stressed plants.
- 11 different competing algorithms were also tested.

The experiments:
1. Water stress 
2. Fertilizer stress
3. Water + Fertilizer stress

Code files, extracted data and results of each experiment are provided.
The "Water Stress Project" word file is a detailed report presenting a literature review, the preprocessing workflow, the experiment design and results.
